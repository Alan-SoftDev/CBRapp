Welcome to CBRapp (Computer Book Review application)!

CBRapp rep contains both front-end and back-end code:

- The front-end was built using React, Apollo Client, JavaScript (ES6), HTML and CSS.
- The back-end was created using Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo Server and MySQL database. It also uses a book RESTfull API. 

Users must log in using their GitHub accounts (OAuth2). Then, they can search for computer books, read and like reviews written by others, and also write their own reviews for each book. They cannot write more than one review for each book or like a review more than once. Furthermore, they cannot like their own reviews.
