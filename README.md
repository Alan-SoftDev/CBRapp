Welcome to my computer book review application called CBRapp.

This full-stack application represents some of my experience.

CBRapp contains both the front-end and back-end scripts as below:

- At the front-end, I have built a React.js app using Apollo-Clien, JavaScript (ES+6), HTML and CSS.
- At the back-end, I have created a GraphQL API using Node.js, GraphQL and Apollo-Server that is connenctied to a book RESTfull API, and a MySQL database. 

Users must login using their GitHub accounts and can search books, read and like reviews written by others, and also write their own reviews for each book. They cannot writhe more than one review for each book or like a review more than one. Also they cannot like their own reviews.
