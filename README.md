This full-stack app represents some of my experience.
CBRapp is a Computer Book Review application. 
I have built a GraphQL API that provides connenctions to a RESTfull API for book information, and a MySQL database for data storage. 
User must login using GitHub OAuth and can search books, read/like reviews and write their own reviews.
